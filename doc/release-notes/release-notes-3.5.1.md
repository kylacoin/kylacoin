How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Kylacoin-Qt` (on macOS)
or `kylacoind`/`kylacoin-qt` (on Linux).

Notable changes
===============

- Resolved synchronization issues with the Flex algorithm on slower CPUs.
- Updated chain parameters.
